Quran Mobile App Development Plan - Phase 1

Objective: Develop the initial version of the Quran app with core functionality: displaying Quran text (Arabic), English translation, and basic Surah/Ayah navigation.

Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Display

Add Dependencies:

Add the quran_flutter package to your pubspec.yaml file.

Run flutter pub get in your terminal to install the new package.

Basic UI Structure:

Surah List Screen:

This screen will display a list of all Surahs.

Each list item will show the Surah number and its name (e.g., "1. Al-Fatiha").

When a user taps on a Surah, they will be navigated to the Surah Display Screen.

Surah Display Screen:

This screen will display the Ayahs of the Surah selected by the user.

For each Ayah, both the original Arabic text and its English translation will be shown.

Users will be able to scroll through the Ayahs of the Surah.

Data Integration (using quran_flutter):

Utilize the quran_flutter package to:

Fetch the complete list of Surahs to populate the Surah List Screen.

Fetch the Arabic text and the corresponding English translation for all Ayahs of the selected Surah to display on the Surah Display Screen.

Navigation:

Implement navigation logic to move from the Surah List Screen to the Surah Display Screen. This will involve passing the identifier (e.g., Surah number) of the selected Surah so the correct content can be loaded.
